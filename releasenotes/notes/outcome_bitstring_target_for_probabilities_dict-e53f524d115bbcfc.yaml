    The :class:'.StabilizerState' class now has a new method 
    :meth:'~.StabilizerState.probabilities_dict_from_bitstring' allowing the 
    user to pass single bitstring to measure an outcome for. Previouslly the 
    :meth:'~.StabilizerState.probabilities_dict' would be utilized and would 
    always calculated (2^n) number of probabilbity calculations even if a user 
    wanted a single result. With this new method it will only calculate the 
    single outcome bitstring value a user passes to measure the probability for. 
    As the number of qubits increases, the more prevelant the performance 
    enhancement will be as 1 bitstring result is measured instead of 2^n.
