    The :class:'.StabilizerState' class now has a new method :meth:'~.StabilizerState.probabilities_dict_from_bitstrings'
    allowing the user to pass in a string or list or string targets to calculate probabilities for. Previouslly this
    would always calculate (2^n) number of probabilbity calculations, but now will only calculate the necessary probabilbites to 
    calculate the targets provided. As the number of qubits increases, the more prevelant the performance enhancement will be. The
    method also has caching abilities implemented, which can be enabled or disabled via bool, to help performance when calculating multiple targets.
    The closer the paths of the calculations of previously calculated targets, the better the method will perform. The logic in method 
    :meth:'~.StabilizerState.probabilities_dict' was moved to method :meth:'~.StabilizerState.probabilities_dict_from_bitstrings' and 
    :meth:'~.StabilizerState.probabilities_dict' now calls :meth:'~.StabilizerState.probabilities_dict_from_bitstrings' with no target parm set.
    No changes will need to be made for previous calls to :meth:'~.StabilizerState.probabilities_dict', and caching is disabled when no targets are provided, 
    which causes no extra overhead for the :meth:'~.StabilizerState.probabilities_dict' mehtod.
